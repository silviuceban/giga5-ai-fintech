        "message": " The sky appears blue due to a process called Rayleigh scattering. In this process, the short-wavelength light (blue and violet) is scattered more than other colors because it travels in smaller, shorter wavelengths. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue. However, during sunrise or sunset, we see red, orange, and yellow hues because the sunlight has to pass through a thicker layer of the atmosphere, allowing longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) to be scattered more effectively.",
